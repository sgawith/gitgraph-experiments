# GitGraph experiments

In order to nicely document the branching strategy for our project, we need to be able to draw nice diagrams to show how we maintain the various versions of the product that we're supporting and developing.

[GitGraphJS](http://gitgraphjs.com/) appears to meet our needs perfectly, so this repository is a point for experimenting and working on the diagrams.
